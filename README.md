## Golang config watcher

A small wrapper for Viper library that only calls callbacks for values that changed (Viper only has a single
OnConfigChange callback).

This project is made just for fun and is not intended to be used as a library. However, if you have any interesting
ideas, go ahead and suggest them.

### Usage
